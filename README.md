## General info
The project allows a user to play a game of rock, paper, scissors against an imaginary opponent. While the user is allowed to make his own pick, the pick of the "house" is randomized.

Winning a game earns the user a score. Losing games decrements the score count.

## Technologies
* React JS
* CSS
* Hooks

## Further improvments
* Clicking on the rules button should show a modal page with rules of the game.
* Optimally, the game should allow people to play against each other, not just the randomized opponent.
